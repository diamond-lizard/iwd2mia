Installation (English) :

The purpose of this mod is to ameliorate the bigg's mod; it can't work alone, for it only replaces some graphic files (.mos and .chu)

You have to install this mod after having installed Widescreen. Just extract the zip file and run "setup.exe" (for Windows users only - Mac or Linux users may proceed to a manual installation).

Manual installation

If you prefer or have to proceed to a manual installation, you can simply do it by copying the  .mos and .chu  files, located in the subfolders of the same name as the resolution you have choiced when installing Widescreen, into IWD2 \override folder.

For example, if you installed a 1600x900 resolution with Widescreen, you'll have to :

  - copy the .mos files in the subfolder \mos\1600 into IWD2 \override folder.
  - copy the file guiw10.chu located in the subfolder \chu\1600x900 into IWD2 \override folder.

If you want to change again the resolution with Widescreen, you'll don't have to delete this files : just run the setup-widescreen.exe to make the changes and, obviously, copy the new files in the same way you just did.
